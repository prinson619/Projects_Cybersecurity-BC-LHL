### P3: Log Monitoring Workflow
**Tools Used:**  
[Bash, CRON, Pythion, Windows Task Scheduler]

**Description:** This project presents a security monitoring and reporting workflow developed for *Turn a New Leaf*, a non-profit organization supporting youth employment in rural communities. The workflow analyzes system logs to identify suspicious activities such as repeated failed login attempts and access to unknown websites. Findings are summarized and reported to management for review. The project supports regulatory compliance while improving visibility into potential security incidents. 

**Report:** [Turn a New Leaf; Log Monitoring Workflow]

### P4: Playbook for Cat & Box Scenario
**Tools Used:**  
[MITRE ATT&CK, NIST]

**Description:** This project presents an incident response playbook developed for *Box Manufacturing* to defend against brute force attacks. Created in collaboration with a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP), the playbook defines a structured response workflow based on CISA guidelines. It outlines key phases, triggers, escalation procedures, and coordination roles to ensure rapid detection, containment, and recovery. The playbook aims to minimize business impact while strengthening the organization’s security readiness.

### P6: Project 6 - *Cat's Company* Vulnerabilities
**Tools Used:**  
[OpenVAS, Linux Server, Windows 11, NIST, MITRE CWE, OWASP]

**Description:** This project presents a vulnerability assessment conducted for *Cat Company* on January 23, 2025, using OpenVAS to identify security weaknesses across Linux and Windows environments. The scan revealed vulnerabilities with key findings. Vulnerabilities were evaluated using CVSS scoring to prioritize risk. The project concludes with short and long-term mitigation recommendations to strengthen access control, patch management, and network security.

**Report:** [Vulnerability Assessment Report; Cat Company]

### P7: IR Plan, Playbook and Policy
**Tools Used:**  
[NIST, MITRE ATT&CK]

**Description:** This project focuses on developing an Incident Response Plan for the organization, BC Ferries in the event of a Ransomware attack. It integrates a detailed Ransomware Incident Response Playbook with high-level organizational security policies to ensure swift, structured, and compliant responses to the related security incident. The plan minimizes operational disruptions, protects sensitive data, and fosters regulatory compliance.

**Disclaimer:** This project was only conducted for educational perposes and not affiliated with BC Ferries in any way.

**Report:** [IR Plan, Playbook and Policy; BC Ferries]

### P10: Forensics Report and Documentation
**Tools Used:**  
[Volatility, FTK Imager, Registry Explorer, Wireshark, VirusTotal, TimeLine Explorer, MITRE ATT&CK, Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain]

**Description:** This project analyzes the “Stolen Szechuan Sauce” digital forensics case to investigate a security breach using disk, memory, registry, and network artifacts. The analysis identifies an RDP brute-force attack as the initial entry vector, the presence of malware, and the compromise of sensitive data. Multiple forensic tools were used to reconstruct the attack timeline and malicious activity. The project concludes with recommended mitigation strategies to strengthen account security and prevent future breaches.

**Report:** [Case 001 – The Stolen Szechuan Sauce; Taken from: DFIR Madness]

### Capstone Project: Incident Response Report
**Tools Used:**  
[MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, OWASP, Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, Nmap, Wireshark 4.4.2]

**Description:** This project examines a targeted cyberattack on *Premium House Lights Inc. (PHL)* that occurred on February 19, 2022, resulting in the exfiltration of sensitive data and a ransom demand. The attack is analyzed using the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain to outline the attacker’s methods and progression. PHL’s response is evaluated through the NIST Incident Response framework. The project concludes with recommendations to strengthen security controls and reduce the risk of future incidents.

**Report:** [Data Breach Report; Premium House Lights Inc.]
